# iNeuron Python Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the Python assignments provided by iNeuron as part of their Python for Data Science course.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following Python packages:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- etc. (depending on the assignments)

You can install these packages using the pip package manager. For example, to install NumPy, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt: pip install numpy
